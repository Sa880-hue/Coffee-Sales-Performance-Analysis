## How to Connect SQL with Excel

> You can directly execute MySQL queries and refresh Pivot Tables from Excel using the built-in **Data > Get Data > From MySQL Database** connector.

### Steps:

1. **Enable MySQL Connector**
   - Install: [MySQL for Excel Add-In](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/excel/)
   - Ensure MySQL server is running (e.g., via XAMPP or phpMyAdmin)

2. **Open Excel**
   - Go to `Data > Get Data > From Database > From MySQL Database`

3. **Enter Server Details**
   - Server: `localhost`
   - Port: `3306`
   - Database: `your_database_name` (e.g., coffeefactory)

4. **Choose Table/View or Paste SQL Query**
   - You can import full tables or click **Advanced options** to run a custom SQL query.

5. **Load as Table or Pivot Table**
   - Choose how to load the data (Table, Pivot Table, or Power Query)

6. **Refresh Easily**
   - Once connected, just click "Refresh All" to pull live updates.
